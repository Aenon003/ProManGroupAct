    <h1>Project Management Group Activity</h1>
    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Project Initiation</p><br>
    <p>Meeting with the client:</p>
    <p id="tab">A meeting with the client is conducted to understand their vision, objectives, and specific requirements
        for the website and AI chatbot. This includes discussions on the chatbot’s role in providing mental health
        resources, supporting appointment scheduling, and addressing privacy concerns for sensitive data. The meeting
        also covers the target audience, system integration needs, and design preferences.

    <p>Data gathering and organization:</p>
    <p id="tab">Data gathering involves collecting relevant content such as FAQs, mental health guides, and researching
        the use of AI in mental health care. The gathered data is then organized into categories such as chatbot
        dialogue, website content, and user flows, while identifying key user personas to guide the design and
        development process.
    </p><br>
    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Project Planning</p>
    <p>Data Utilization:</p>
    <p id="tab">This involves analyzing and integrating the collected content, such as FAQs, mental health resources,
        and user personas, into the chatbot’s framework. This ensures the AI chatbot provides relevant and accurate
        information to users, addressing their needs effectively. The data is also used to structure the website’s
        content, ensuring that it aligns with the goals of the Cavite Center for Mental Health and enhances user
        experience.
    </p><br>
    <p>Web Layout planning:</p>
    <p id="tab">This focuses on creating a user-friendly design, including a clear text structure and intuitive
        navigation. The layout must prioritize accessibility and ease of use, with a well-organized interface that
        highlights key features like chatbot access, mental health resources, and appointment scheduling. The text
        structure should ensure clarity and readability, guiding users smoothly through the site while maintaining a
        professional and welcoming tone.

        are shared with the client through meetings about the progress, where the team discusses the current work
        status, gathers feedback, and adjusts plans if necessary. <br>
    </p>
    <p id="tab">After development, Testing is carried out with volunteered users to evaluate the functionality,
        usability, and
        performance of both the website and the chatbot. Feedback from testing is used to make final adjustments before
        moving on to Implementation, where the fully developed website and AI chatbot are deployed for public use.</p>

        and adjust the chatbot’s algorithms as needed. This empowers the administrator to update responses, add new
        features, and refine the chatbot's performance based on user interactions and feedback.
    </p><br>
    <p>Review:</p>
    <p id="tab">Final Meeting with the Client serves as a review of the project outcomes, where the team presents the
        completed website and AI chatbot, discusses the overall performance, and gathers final feedback. This meeting is
        crucial for addressing any outstanding concerns and ensuring the client is satisfied with the deliverables.
        Discussions around Potential Changes and Upgrades explore future enhancements to the website and chatbot. This
        includes identifying areas for improvement, potential new features, or expansions that could enhance user
